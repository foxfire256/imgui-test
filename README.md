# imgui-test (ImGUI Test)

This program displays the demo for Dear ImGUI using SDL2 and OpenGL 3.2.

## Compiling

SDL2, GLEW, OpenGL 3.x+, Freetype2 and a C++ 11 compiler are required to compile this.

## Running

A graphics card and driver supporting OpenGL 3.2 or later are required to run this application. It should work on Windows and most Linux distributions. This has been tested on Windows 10 and openSUSE Tumbleweed. You can probably make it work on a Mac as well.
